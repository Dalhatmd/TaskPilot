# TaskPilot 📝✨  
An AI-powered task manager that helps users stay organized, prioritize effectively, and plan their day with ease.  

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building  
TaskPilot is a **smart task manager** that combines simple task organization with the power of AI.  
- **Core Features:** Create, edit, delete, and categorize tasks.  
- **AI Features:**  
  - Suggest priorities and deadlines when adding tasks.  
  - Summarize daily tasks into a clear natural-language overview.  
  - Generate a daily plan based on workload.  

---

## 👥 Who It’s For  
- **Students** who need help managing assignments and deadlines.  
- **Professionals** juggling multiple projects and meetings.  
- **Anyone** looking for a personal assistant to bring clarity and focus to their daily schedule.  

---

## 🌟 Why It Matters  
Managing tasks can be overwhelming. TaskPilot uses AI to **reduce decision fatigue**, helping users focus on what matters most. Instead of just storing tasks, it acts like a **co-pilot** that organizes, prioritizes, and guides your day.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
**Languages & Frameworks**  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or SQLite for quick setup)  
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication  
- **AI:** OpenAI API or Google Gemini  

**Tools**  
- Docker (containerization)  
- Git + GitHub (version control)  
- Postman (API testing)

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy  

### 1. Code Generation  
- Use **Cursor / AI-enabled IDE** to scaffold backend routes (CRUD, auth).  
- AI-assisted boilerplate setup for React components and forms.  
- Prompt-based generation of repetitive code (models, serializers, API calls).  

### 2. Testing  
- AI prompts to auto-generate **unit tests** (for FastAPI endpoints and React components).  
- Integration test scaffolding suggested via AI using `pytest`.  
- AI-assisted debugging by feeding error traces into prompts for quick fixes.  

### 3. Documentation  
- Auto-generate **docstrings** for Python functions and classes with AI.  
- Inline comments drafted with AI for clarity in complex logic.  
- **README** and setup instructions maintained with AI summaries of file trees and feature diffs.  

### 4. Context-Aware Techniques  
- Feed **API specs** into AI to generate frontend service functions.  
- Share **file trees** with AI to help scaffold or refactor components.  
- Use **git diffs** as prompt context to generate commit messages, changelogs, and documentation updates.
