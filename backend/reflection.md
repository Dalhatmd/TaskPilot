# Reflection on AI in My Build Process

## Introduction

Throughout the development of TaskPilot, AI played a transformative role in shaping my workflow, decision-making, and overall productivity. Leveraging AI tools for code generation, review, and documentation fundamentally changed how I approached building a full-stack application, especially when working with unfamiliar technologies.

## Step-by-Step AI Implementation

One of the most effective strategies was guiding the AI to implement modules step by step. By breaking down the project into discrete tasks—such as setting up authentication, building CRUD endpoints, integrating AI summarization, and connecting the frontend—I was able to maintain clarity and control over the build process. This incremental prompting allowed me to focus on one feature at a time, review the generated code, and ensure each module worked before moving on. The AI excelled at following these structured prompts, producing boilerplate code, scaffolding new files, and even suggesting best practices for integration and testing.

## What Worked Well

AI was particularly helpful in automating repetitive tasks, generating documentation, and handling boilerplate code. For example, when setting up FastAPI endpoints or React components, the AI provided clear, consistent code that adhered to modern standards. Its ability to quickly scaffold new modules and refactor existing ones saved significant time. Additionally, using AI to generate commit messages streamlined my workflow, ensuring that each change was clearly documented and easy to track.

Coderabbit, an AI-powered code review tool, added another layer of confidence before pushing changes. It helped catch subtle bugs, suggested improvements, and validated that my code met quality standards. This automated review process reduced the cognitive load and made collaboration smoother.

## Limitations and Challenges

Despite these advantages, there were notable limitations. Prompting the AI to work with a programming language I was not already familiar with proved challenging. While the AI could generate syntactically correct code, my lack of domain knowledge made it difficult to assess the quality, debug issues, or understand deeper architectural decisions. This highlighted the importance of having at least a foundational understanding of the language or framework being used, as AI is not a substitute for core technical knowledge.

Another limitation was the occasional need for highly specific or nuanced code. AI sometimes struggled with edge cases or complex business logic, requiring manual intervention and iterative refinement. This made the review and iteration process crucial—prompting, reviewing, and then iterating based on feedback was essential to achieving reliable results.

## Lessons Learned

The build process taught me valuable lessons about working with AI:
- **Prompting**: Clear, step-by-step prompts yield the best results. Ambiguous or overly broad requests often lead to generic or incomplete code.
- **Reviewing**: Automated tools like coderabbit are invaluable, but manual review remains necessary, especially for unfamiliar languages or complex logic.
- **Iterating**: Building in small increments and iterating based on feedback ensures higher code quality and reduces the risk of major issues.

## Conclusion

AI significantly accelerated my development process, especially for tasks within my technical comfort zone. Its strengths lie in automation, documentation, and rapid prototyping. However, its limitations become apparent when venturing into unfamiliar territory or handling complex requirements. By combining step-by-step prompting, thorough review, and iterative development, I was able to harness AI's capabilities while mitigating its weaknesses, resulting in a more efficient and enjoyable build experience.
