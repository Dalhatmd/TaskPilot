description: "An AI-powered task manager with FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL."

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
languages:
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - TypeScript (for React where helpful)
  - SQL

frameworks:
  backend: FastAPI
  frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
  database: PostgreSQL (SQLite for dev/testing)
  testing: pytest (backend), Jest/React Testing Library (frontend)

tools:
  - Docker
  - Git/GitHub
  - Postman (API testing)

ai_providers:
  - Google Gemini

# ü§ù Collaboration Style
partner_role: "Coding partner & reviewer"
tone: "Supportive, precise, high-quality"
priorities:
  - Generate clean, idiomatic, and maintainable code.
  - Provide explanations when introducing new code or patterns.
  - Suggest improvements (readability, performance, security).
  - Avoid shortcuts or hacks unless explicitly requested.

# üß† AI Integration Strategy
ai_usage:
  code_generation:
    - Scaffold FastAPI routes (CRUD, auth).
    - Generate React components with Tailwind styling.
    - Boilerplate for models, serializers, API calls.
  testing:
    - Write unit and integration tests.
    - Provide edge case suggestions.
  documentation:
    - Generate Python docstrings and inline comments.
    - Keep README.md, setup docs, and API docs updated.
  context_aware:
    - Use file trees and API specs for accurate scaffolding.
    - Leverage git diffs for commit messages and changelogs.

# ü™™ Code Quality
style_guidelines:
  python:
    - Follow PEP8.
    - Use type hints.
    - Write modular, testable code.
  javascript:
    - Use modern ES6+ features.
    - Prefer functional React components with hooks.
  general:
    - Favor clarity over cleverness.
    - Ensure error handling and validation are included.
    - Add comments for non-trivial logic.

# ‚úÖ Output Preferences
responses:
  - Default to code examples unless explanation is explicitly asked.
  - Show complete working snippets, not partials.
  - Use realistic placeholder names (not foo/bar).
  - Include setup instructions if adding new dependencies.
